# Quick Started

This library is pretty simple to use. all you need to know is some simple python code

To get started,

1. open command prompt

2. type "py" into the command prompt

   ```bash
   Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.19041.572]
   (c) 2020 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

   C:\Users\chris>py
   ```

   (python will start)

3. type "from cs_cheats import \*" and press enter

   ```python
   Python 3.9.0 (tags/v3.9.0:9cf6752, Oct  5 2020, 15:34:40) [MSC v.1927 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
   Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
   >>> from cs_cheats import *
   >>>
   ```

   (now you are ready to start)

py_cheats is different from in class because it doesn't need the algorithm to be numbered. but what it does need is for the code to be a working function

## Creating a Function

### Rules

1. use "def" in front of all functions

```python
>>> def lOneTeen(a, b):
```

2. if that line is a function or a question, use a colon at the end of it

3. indent all code inside of a statement

```python
>>> def lOneTeen(a, b):
...   x = a * b
...   if (x > 1):
...      return True
...
```

3. When you are done with a function, keep pressing enter until you get

```python
>>>
```

### Testing

To test your code, simply type it and the parameters into the terminal

python will give you the answer

```python
>>> def lOneTeen(a, b):
...   x = a * b
...   if (x > 1):
...      return True
...
>>> lOneTeen(1, 2)
True
```
